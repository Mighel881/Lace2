Lace allows you to control the lockscreen page with ease. It comes with the following features:

<b>Change While Dragging:</b><br />
If you start swiping from the left side bottom side and moving your finger to the right, it will change from the Toggles page to the Media page. Should theoretically work with more pages, but not tested.

<b>Automode:</b><br />
You can choose to display the Main page if and only if any notification is present, and otherwise show the Today page.

<b>Default section:</b><br />
Choose to always show the Main page or the Today page.
